Package: HMMRATAC
Title: HMMRATAC - a semi-supervised machine learning approach for identifying
    open chromatin regions from ATAC-Seq data using Hidden Markov Models.
Description: Hidden Markov ModeleR for ATAC-seq (HMMRATAC) is a semi-supervised
    machine learning appraoch for identifying open chromatin regions from
    ATAC-seq data. The ATAC-seq data is decomposed into different layers of
    coverage signal corresponding to the sequnced DNA fragments originated from
    nucleosomal regions. The relationship between the layers of signals at open
    chromatin. This package is an R implementation of the original java package
    meant to function within Bioconductor.
